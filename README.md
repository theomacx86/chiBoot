# chiBoot

chiBoot is a little X64 UEFI bootloader aimed at booting my own operaring system.

For now it only boots chiOS and relocates it to a higher half, but really it can take any ELF file and load it into virtual memory and pass some informations. So down the line anyone who wants to make their kernel can boot with chiBoot.
